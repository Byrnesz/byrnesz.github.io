## America The Great Experiment in Liberalism.  

Our Founding Fathers created the greatest social science project of all time, for all the right reasons, against all odds, in the name of freedom and liberties for all, under God!

''The United States of America'', forged from concepts, academic excellence and wisdom acquired from the "old world" stumbled, got-up, stumbled again, fought, adjusted, failed, learned and kept going to become the greatest nation on Earth.  The ingredients necessary for this to happen came from the solid foundation built upon the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.   A representative form of democracy formed the structure of government.   

American political doctrine is based entirely on ''Liberalism'', that emphasizes individual autonomy, equality of opportunity, and the protection of individual rights (primarily to life, liberty, and property), originally against the state and later against both the state and private economic actors, including businesses.  

### Liberalism  

The intellectual founders of liberalism were the English philosopher John Locke (1632-1704), who developed a theory of political authority based on natural individual rights and the consent of the governed, and the Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith (1723-1790), who argued that societies prosper when individuals are free to pursue their self-interest within an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and competitive markets, controlled neither by the state nor by private monopolies.  

## U.S. History  

The idea/concept behind the great American experiment was that of classical liberalism.  Without treading into deep waters regarding philosophical opinions in general, let me say only that America had no shortage of intellectual capacity to debate pro's and con's of all sub-categories related to liberalism.  It was clearly understood that Liberalism needs many checks and balances in order to maintain it's primary tenets and keep in check the inevitable temptations of control that was a large by-product of wealth that enabled power.  Liberalism was predicted to fuel wealth, power and control and some like Adam Smith fully realized the extent of personal wealth and power attainable, especially when liberalism bends more away from societal considerations and stays true to European Aristocracy, meaning an updated social status (tier) structure and limited political participation, based on gender and skin color along with a market based economy.    European white males (Caucasian) would have a privileged status for quite some time.  

## A work in progress  

This is the beginning of a larger body of work that compares and contrasts America (founding and early struggles), America 1 (the real America shows its colors), America 2 (industrial post world war 2), America 3 (late 1970's - 2001) to America 4 (modern America, post 9/11 to present).

### Best code snippet ever:



```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
