Yep, today is the day after yesterday. But, now what?

Social distancing, stay at home orders and no toliet paper are great, but seems like we are missing something.  Maybe a blizzard in LA or herds of Canadian Buffalo, Elk and Moose spontaneously gather in Winnipeg, have a few Molson's, decide to join together to form a powerful army of activists, elect a leader (a giant Moose) and go about the business of creating a huge army of four legged animal activists.  Their mission; to invade the United States, remove the Orangeman and restore basic civility and adult societal behaviors.  This is not a coup d'etat, it is devine restoritive action, delivered by many like minded Canadian four legged large animals, led by a giant Moose.

The communicate via Ruby code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Moose')
#=> prints 'Hi, Moose' to STDOUT.
```
