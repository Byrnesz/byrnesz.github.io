WHY?

Why not? If the idea of free speech, truth, strong opinions, unique sense of humor, life stories and situations all told with no regard to political correctness and sprinkled with various creative stuff bothers you, leave!

My full name is: David Mathew, Michael Kevin OByrne III.  Irish families seem to have a lot of children.  I am one of 15.  Never had money, one pair of shoes, holy underwear (:) and lots of smokes and booze.  Church every Sunday, Wednesday and Friday.  Strip clubs every night.  I now have 9 kids with 5 different women though still married to my wife (god bless her)! Four of my kids are still in school, three in prison, one homeless and the other is a US Senator.

This is my dog, Brainfart.
